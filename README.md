# BonziBuddy RENEWED
Welcome to BonziBuddy RENEWED! BonziBuddy RENEWED is a built from the ground up (using primarly MASH, vbscript and batch file) malware-free version of the BonziBuddy also aiming to include more features than the original one. As of now it's still in it's early stages so it hasn't got much features but in each release ill stuff in some features. Also i'll work on this project in my free time so don't expect super frequent releases.

As of now he can Speak, Tell Jokes, Tell Amazing Facts, Browse and even introduce himself! and much more in the future!

# Anvitiruses

For some reason this project gets flagged by a decent amount of antiviruses and antiviruses engines. I assume because the script isn't the most organized so im using a bunch of external scripts to interact with the main MASH script so this behaviour may get detected as malware. I'll try my best to fix this in future updates.

Hope you'll like this project!
