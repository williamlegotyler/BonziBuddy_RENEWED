# BonziBuddy RENEWED
Welcome to BonziBuddy RENEWED! BonziBuddy RENEWED is a built from the ground up (using primarly MASH, vbscript and batch file) malware-free version of the BonziBuddy also aiming to include more features than the original one. As of now it's still in it's early stages so it hasn't got much features but in each release ill stuff in some features. Also i'll work on this project in my free time so don't expect super frequent releases.

As of now he can Speak, Tell jokes and even introduce himself! and much more in the future!

# Anvitiruses

For some reason this project gets flagged by a decent amount of antiviruses and antiviruses engines. I assume because the script isn't the most organized so im using a bunch of external scripts to interact with the main MASH script so this behaviour may get detected as malware. I'll try my best to fix this in future updates.

# Running on newer windows versions

As of now still didn't test on modern windows versions, this is developed and tested under windows xp but i can expect what would happen when running it on modern windows: it would be pretty broken as of now. Because modern windows has got UAC and other stuff which as of now does not provide a flawless experience. So expect this to be able to run flawlessly on modern windows at around version 0.2.0.

Hope you'll like this project!
